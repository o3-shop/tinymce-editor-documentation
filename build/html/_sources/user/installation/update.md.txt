# Update

## Ensure

Ensure you have an error-free Composer installation of the Shop.

Check your system health in the Shop Admin at 'Servie' -> 'System health'.

## Prepare

Create a backup of the shop. This includes the database and the files on the server.

## Perform

Open a shell in the main store directory and run the composer command below.

```
composer require o3-shop/tinymce-editor
```

```{note}
The update will overwrite any changes you may have made to the module in the source directory.

Background: During an update, Composer first loads the new data into the **vendor** directory. Then the data is copied to the **source** directory. This replaces the files.
```
