# Migrate from OXID eShop

In principle, a migration between the OXID eShop and O3-Shop is possible, but we recommend a new installation to get a clean installation.

## Requirements for a migration

Please ensure that *all* requirements are met beforehand:

- an error-free Composer installation of the OXID eShop
- OXID eShop in version 6.4.3

  For older shop versions, please carry out the update offered by OXID eSales to the named shop version beforehand. Newer OXID shops (> 6.4.3) cannot be migrated.
- OXID eShop Community Edition 

  The migration only supports Community Editions. The migration of Professional or Enterprise Editions is not supported.
- The OXID eShop was installed via the package “oxid-esales/oxideshop-project”.

  Check if “oxid-esales/oxideshop-project” is mentioned as “name” in the file “composer.json” in the main directory of your shop. If you use a different package composition, please check its components manually to see if they can be replaced.

## Updating the system environment

If the system environment is to be updated with the migration or update (e.g. more recent mySQL version), please carry out the update or migration in advance and only update your system afterwards.

## Perform migration

### Create backup

Before migrating, create a backup of the shop. This includes the database and the files on the server

### Replace packages

Execute the following Composer commands individually on the console in the main directory of your shop.

```
composer require -W o3-shop/shop-metapackage-ce:^1.0 --no-scripts --no-plugins
composer require -W o3-shop/testing-library:^1.0 o3-shop/shop-ide-helper:^1.0 --dev --no-plugins --no-scripts
composer config extra.incenteev-parameters.dist-file 'vendor/o3-shop/testing-library/test_config.yml.dist'
composer remove oxid-esales/oxideshop-metapackage-ce --no-scripts --no-plugins
composer remove oxid-esales/testing-library:^1.0 oxid-esales/oxideshop-ide-helper:^1.0 --dev --no-scripts --no-plugins
composer require o3-shop/shop-metapackage-ce:^1.0
```

Confirm all overwrite requests with “y”.

If the Azure theme is explicitly installed in your shop

```
composer remove oxid-esales/azure-theme --dev
```

### Data migration

To do this, run the following command.

```
vendor/bin/oe-eshop-db_migrate migrations:migrate
```

Regenerate the database views.

Background: Depending on the changes and the shop edition, the shop may go into maintenance mode after the update.
To prevent this, regenerate the database views with the following command:

```
vendor/bin/oe-shop-db_views_generate
```


### Complete migration

In the case of additional packages installed by OXID or individual compositions of the shop project, please check which packages need to be replaced from “oxid-esales” to “o3-shop”.
